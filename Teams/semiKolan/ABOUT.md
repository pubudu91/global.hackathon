All the team members are Computer Science Undergraduates from University of Moratuwa. And love learning new
technologies, and we can't think of any other better way to learn than by applying the things that we learned. 

Judges will read this page before making a final decision, so write your story, make it emotional and impressive.
Tell us why you want to win.


What we plan to do... 
=======
Don't reveal too much about your project, this is a competition but maybe
you can tell us the technologies, APIs you are going to use and what kind
of application you are going to build.

You can change your mind, that's ok. Just push an update here when you do.
